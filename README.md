<sub>*Data Scientist | Data Analyst | Statistician | Web Developer*</sub>

I study Statistics since 2020 and I have 1 year of experience as a Data Scientist in solving real problems of companies, contained in this portfolio of projects.

I went through all the stages of developing a business solution using Data Science concepts and tools, from understanding the business to publishing the model using Clouds. I have already developed solutions for important business problems such as sales forecast for 6 weeks ahead, analysis of the best properties to buy and sell and construction of database for basic bank transfer.

My goal is to improve my knowledge more and more by carrying out more projects for this portfolio.

## Data Science Projects:

### [Rossmann Sales Predict]( https://github.com/rodrigo-rngl/MyDataProjectsPortfolio/blob/master/Data%20Science%20Projects/rossmann_sales_predict )

In this project, I developed a Machine Learning model capable of predicting sales for all stores of a large European drugstore, with the objective of defining how much the company would collect in 6 weeks ahead.
The performance of this model, which has only **9.3% of average error**, allows the manager to take more structured and accurate management measures.

## Data Analysis - Insights Projets:

### [King County Houses]( https://github.com/rodrigo-rngl/MyDataProjectsPortfolio/tree/master/Insights%20Projects/king_county_houses ) 

In this project, I selected the best properties in King County, USA for purchase and sale, through Data Analysis and hypothesis validation. This analysis generated a profit for the real estate company of $1,040,406.06

## Data Base Projects:
